      <description>Add at least one actual blog post about the python stuff we have been working on: this can be anything, but must include some python code that executes in a python code chunk (i.e.,{python} #your code) and includes output (can even be examples from hw assignments, etc).
Also, it must include at least one local image from static/img/. You can include images in various ways, including or , or using the insert image feature in the toolbar.</description>

      <description>Using the online demographic research tool ‘Social Explorer’, I gathered data relating to health and demographics for Texas counties in 2017. For each dataset, I chose data pertaining to the first 53 counties in Texas. I originally wanted to look at data from all of the 254 counties in Texas, but I quickly realized that was too much data for this project. In an effort to eliminate bias in choosing which counties to look at, I came up with the idea of choosing the first 53 counties after ordering them alphabetically.</description>
