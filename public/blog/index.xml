      <description>Add at least one actual blog post about the python stuff we have been working on: this can be anything, but must include some python code that executes in a python code chunk (i.e.,{python} #your code) and includes output (can even be examples from hw assignments, etc).
Also, it must include at least one local image from static/img/. You can include images in various ways, including or , or using the insert image feature in the toolbar.</description>
