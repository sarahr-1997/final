Reticulate is a super helpful tool if you need to go between Python and R. Say you want to load a data set in python but manipulate it with dplr functions in RStudio; reticulate is the tool for you! Another time when reticulate could be helpful is if you are trying to graph data (maybe using ggplot()) that you previously mantipulated with python. 


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(reticulate)
library(dplyr)
x <- "If you need to go"
```

```{python}
y = "between r and python, use reticulate."
print (r.x,y)
```
