This is a picture from the National Geographic museum in Washington, D.C.. It's a picture of a wall in the museum that is covered in a ton of different magazine covers. I love the variety of colors and topics. 

Reticulate is a super helpful tool if you need to go between Python and R. Say you want to load a data set in python but manipulate it with dplr functions in RStudio; reticulate is the tool for you! Another time when reticulate could be helpful is if you are trying to graph data (maybe using ggplot()) that you previously mantipulated with python. 


```{r}
library(reticulate)
x <- "If you need to go"
```

```{python}
y = "between r and python, use reticulate."
print (r.x,y)
```
