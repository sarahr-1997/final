This is a picture from the National Geographic museum in Washington, D.C.. It’s a picture of a wall in the museum that is covered in a ton of different magazine covers. I love the variety of colors and topics.</p>
<p>Reticulate is a super helpful tool if you need to go between Python and R. Say you want to load a data set in python but manipulate it with dplr functions in RStudio; reticulate is the tool for you! Another time when reticulate could be helpful is if you are trying to graph data (maybe using ggplot()) that you previously mantipulated with python.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(reticulate)
x &lt;- &quot;If you need to go&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>y = &quot;between r and python, use reticulate.&quot;
print (r.x,y)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## If you need to go between r and python, use reticulate.</code></pre>
