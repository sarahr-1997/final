<p>Add at least one actual blog post about the python stuff we have been working on: this can be anything, but must include some python code that executes in a python code chunk (i.e.,{python} #your code) and includes output (can even be examples from hw assignments, etc). You are encouraged to use reticulate to let R and Python talk to each other in chunks! That way you can do it straight from R markdown in python code chunks. Also, it must include at least one local image from static/img/. You can include images in various ways, including <img src="image.png" /> or <img src="image.png">, or using the insert image feature in the toolbar.</p>
